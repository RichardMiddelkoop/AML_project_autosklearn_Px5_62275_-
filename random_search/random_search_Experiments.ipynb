        "This notebook is organized in multiple steps, grouped in sections and subsections.\n",
        "1. Set up  \n",
        "    - install auto-sklearn\n",
        "    - mount google drive\n",
        "    - import packages\n",
        "    - set paths for save/load\n",
        "2. STEP A - Fetch datasets from OpenML (run once)\n",
        "    - using sklearn API to fetch (multiple) datasets from OpenML\n",
        "    - save each dataset as a pickle (.pkl), containing a dict with 'x', 'y' as keys and data as values, named as openml_datasetID.pkl\n",
        "    - this step is intended to be run once only, afterwards user can load the data from pickle rather than fetch again which is time consuming. If you already have datasets in data folder, skip STEP A.\n",
        "3. STEP B - Compute meta features (optional)\n",
        "    - compute the meta features from pickle files, and write result to 'meta_features.pkl'\n",

        "4. STEP C - Run experiment\n",

        "        - set up experiment by choosing budgets, datasets etc.\n",
        "        - set up autosklearn classifier or modify settings\n",

        "        - proceed to start experiment, a nested loop over datasets (outer) and seeds (inner) repeating the procedure \n",
        "            - train-test-split\n",
        "            - train classifier on train set\n",
        "           - evaluate balanced accuracy on test set\n",
        "        - generate an unique timestamp id at the beginning\n",
        "        - results are gathered in a 'res' dict with keys 'cls' and 'acc' containing the trained classifier and test accuracy\n",
        "    3. Save (recommended)\n",
        "        - save the 'res' dict to 'experiment_id.pkl' in results \n",

        "        - storage warning: file size ~ 1.2GB for 190 trained classifiers + acc, make sure you have sufficient space, else do not save classifiers\n",
