Set up  \n","    - install auto-sklearn\n","    - mount google drive\n","    - import packages\n","    - set paths for save/load\n","2. STEP A - Fetch datasets from OpenML (run once)\n","    - using sklearn API to fetch (multiple) datasets from OpenML\n","    - save each dataset as a pickle (.pkl), containing a dict with 'x', 'y' as keys and data as values, named as openml_datasetID.pkl\n","    - this step is intended to be run once only, afterwards user can load the data from pickle rather than fetch again which is time consuming. If you already have datasets in data folder, skip STEP A.\n","3. STEP B - Compute meta features (optional)\n","    - compute the meta features from pickle files, and write result to 'meta_features.pkl'\n","    - as meta info\n","    - to test whether the data loading works correctly\n","    - to test whether the saving result works correctly\n","    - can skip to STEP C\n","4. STEP C - Run experiment\n","    1. Set up\n","        - set up experiment by choosing budgets, datasets etc.\n","        - set up autosklearn classifier or modify settings\n","        - generates seed for reproducbility\n","        - check estimated time to run experiment, make sure you won't encounter session timeout\n","    2. Run\n","        - proceed to start experiment, a nested loop over datasets (outer) and seeds (inner) repeating the procedure \n","            - train-test-split\n","            - train classifier on train set\n","           - evaluate balanced accuracy on test set\n","        - generate an unique timestamp id at the beginning\n","        - results are gathered in a 'res' dict with keys 'cls' and 'acc' containing the trained classifier and test accuracy\n","    3. Save (recommended)\n","        - save the 'res' dict to 'experiment_id.pkl' in results \n","folder\n","        - storage warning: file size ~ 1.2GB for 190 trained classifiers + acc, make sure you have sufficient space, else do not save classifiers\n","        - avoid results loss in colab due to session timeout\n","        - analyze results in separate notebook to keep running experiment\n","        - (to do) saving results after each iteration of outer loop\n","\n","**Particular instruction to colab user:**\n","- 'Run for colab' contains two cells, each with function to\n","    1.   install auto-sklearn on colab, then auto restart runtime.
