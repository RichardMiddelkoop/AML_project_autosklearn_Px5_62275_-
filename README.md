The notebooks are written in a way that is most suited for running on google colab and saving the results on google drive.
Each cell of the notebook has instructions on what the cell does and when it should be used.

NOTE: the paths used in the notebooks are written for our own drive, this needs to be changed to the path to your desired folder.
